At the front end we use XML, C, Java, android and Backend PHP, MySQL are used. The different hardware components used in this project are Node MCU, Ultrasonic Sensor, MQ136. NodeMCU is an open source IoT platform. NodeMCU means a firmware rather than a development platform.NodeMCU controls the data traffic between the sensors and the firebase. It consists of analog and digital I/O
pins that communicate with the HCSR04 and MQ136. It is a microcontroller Unit based on the 12E version of the Esp-8266. Ultrasonic sensing is one of the best ways to sense proximity and detect levels of high reliability. MQ136 is used to detect the foul smell in the garbage.
